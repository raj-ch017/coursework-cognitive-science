# **Project: Cognitive Science Coursework**

[MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) is a free and open collection of material from thousands of MIT courses, covering the entire MIT curriculum.

# Overview
This repository has been created to keep track of coursework that follows the undergraduate curriculum of MIT, with additional online courses from platforms like Coursera and Edx.

# Summary 
The objective is to have a formal introduction to the concepts that belong to the field of Brain Science. The structure upon which the coursework will be built is meant to be equivalent to an undergraduate education. 

The project will bring together two of my main interests:

  - Skills in computation to develop tools and methods that can be applied to a particular field
  - A formal knowledge base in Brain Science with introduction to areas of research in which computational skills and methods can be applied
  
These skills are blended in this interdisciplinary degree [Computation and Cognition](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computation-cognition-6-9/). This degree combines the departments of ***Electrical Engineering and Computer Science*** along with ***Brain and Cognitive Sciences***.

However, I would like to have an emphasis that slightly leans toward [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/brain-cognitive-sciences-course-9/). 

# Curriculum
This will serve as a blueprint to take courses according to the degree requirements.

# Resources
The resources are divided into two categories:

- MIT OpenCourseWare - Lectures provided in [OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/)

- Courses - Resources gathered from online platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Edx](https://www.edx.org/)
